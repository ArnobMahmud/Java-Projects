// Java Inheritance (Subclass and Superclass)
// In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to
// another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

// subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
// superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from
// To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.

// In the example below, the Car class (subclass) inherits the attributes and
// methods from the Vehicle class (superclass):
